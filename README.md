## Introduction
The "Discover Paris" Android app is designed to provide users with an interactive and engaging platform for exploring the beautiful city of Paris. The app offers various features to help users discover and experience the rich culture, history, and entertainment the city has to offer. Our goal is to assist tourists in navigating the capital city of France, showcasing the most significant monuments, and making them fall in love with Paris just like we have. The app helps users choose their next destination by offering features such as photos, short descriptions, and map directions. We have also included content for movie enthusiasts, allowing them to visit locations where their favorite movies were filmed.


## Challenges Faced
- **Movie Locations:** Selecting and curating movie locations to provide an interesting and engaging experience for film enthusiasts required careful research and video segmentation.
- **Fortune Wheel:** Designing and implementing the "Fortune Wheel" feature was challenging due to the complexities involved in making the layout and animation visually appealing.

## Project Features
The "Discover Paris" app includes the following key features:

### List of 20 Places
- Users can view a list of 20 popular places in Paris.
- Clicking on a place in the list leads to a detailed page with a picture, description, and the option to get directions via Google Maps.


### Famous Movies
- The app provides information about 6 famous movies related to Paris.
- Users can click on a movie to view a scene from the film via a video player along with a brief description.
- The app allows users to mark places associated with these movies as "visited" or reset this data, which is stored in Shared Preferences for persistence.


### Wheel
- The app features an interactive wheel that displays the names of the 20 places.
- Users can spin the wheel, and it will stop on a random place.
- A dialog box appears with two options: "Go" and "Dismiss."
- Clicking "Go" directs users to the detail page of the selected place.

## What Makes Us Happy About It
What makes us the happiest are the unique features that make us stand out from other guides:
1. Including movie fragments adds an exciting layer to visiting places and allows users to share the same experiences as the characters.
2. The "Fortune Wheel" feature can surprise users by randomly suggesting a location or activity, helping those who have trouble making decisions.

We are also very pleased with the app's good-looking interface and user-friendly design. We are confident that "Discover Paris" will help many users truly get to know and love this beautiful city.
